<h2>Reflection:</h2>

This project was pretty straight forward and even though I was familiar with everything, what made it difficult was the sheer size of the project and the amount of code and files. I 
had never tried to work on an app of this size or add features. However, using ChatGPT was very useful. I was able to learn how to ask it specific questions, and tweak the questions in 
order to get what I wanted. Aside from the development of features and debugging, creating pytests was also a big part of this project. Achieving 90% test coverage can be tedious when 
constantly adding new features, and making sure they run can also be difficult. I was able to learn how files work together and how correctly structuring a project can be useful as the
project grows.

Although there wasn't much direct collaboration for this project, knowing how to use GitHub was very important. Although I tried to make sure all my commits perfects, I ended up having
divergent branches and had to reconcile them. Aside from commits and merges, Issues was also very useful to learn. One of the many features with Issues is the opportunity of
being able to assign different users to different tasks. This facilities collaboration and makes it clear what tasks are the most important, and who's responsibility it is. Altogether
this project refreshed my memory with a lot of different things that I had done before but had forgotten. It also introduced new features that I had not done before but are very useful
to know.
